                <h2>1. Cappuccino</h2>
                <p>Recognised by the froth on top, a cappuccino is one part espresso shot, 
                    one part textured milk and one part froth on top with a dusting of 
                    chocolate to finish</p>
            </p>

            <p class="p">
                <h2>2. Latte</h2>
                <p>A latte is a coffee espresso shot filled with steamed milk and with a 
                    layer of foamed milk crema.</p>
            </p>

            <p class="p">
                <h2>3. Espresso</h2>
                <p>Also known as a short black, an espresso is a single shot of coffee. 
                    No extra hot water is added, resulting in an intense and flavoursome drink</p>
            </p>

                <h2>4. Mocha</h2>
                <p>A latte with the added sweetness of chocolate. A mocha can be prepared by 
                    adding chocolate to the espresso shot before adding the textured milk, 
                    or adding the chocolate to the cold milk before frothing.</p>

            <p class="p">
                <h2>5. Ristretto</h2>

                    coffee but extracted with half the amount of water. This results in a 
                    delicious, concentrated shot. A ristretto is typically enjoyed straight
                     but it can also be combined with milk.</p>
            </p>

            <p class="p">

                    This results in 60 ml of coffee. Doppio means 'double' in Italian.</p>
